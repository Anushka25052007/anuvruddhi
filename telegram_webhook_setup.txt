After the user hits a milestone (badge/certificate/XP), send a GET request to:
https://api.telegram.org/bot7870937947:AAHJY3kj7_P1YUFpqGMWRI2Dx-YfBRfBaHI/sendMessage?chat_id=7010295728&text=Congratulations+<username>+just+earned+10+XP! where <username> is replaced in real-time with the user's actual name. This message should be sent automatically without user interaction and should be triggered every time a task completion or badge unlock event occurs. Ensure that the request uses the correct bot token and Telegram chat ID, and that the system supports dynamic values pulled from Firebase. Keep the message fun and personalized by using the user's name directly in the text. Create an onboarding and authentication system where, the first time a user opens the app, they are shown a welcome screen with the options to “Sign Up” or “Sign In.” Once the user signs up or logs in successfully using Firebase Authentication (via email/password or Google sign-in), save their login state securely using local storage or session logic. From the second launch onwards, automatically bypass the login screen and redirect the user to the Home Screen, unless they explicitly choose to log out. Upon logout, the user should be returned to the sign-in screen for future re-authentication. Now, configure event-based automation using Firebase and Lovable logic to send a Telegram message using a dynamic GET request each time the following events occur: (1) a new user registers, (2) a task milestone is reached (e.g., user completes planting 50 trees), (3) a badge is unlocked, and (4) a certificate is generated. Retrieve the user’s name from Firebase in real-time, and insert it dynamically into the message like this: https://api.telegram.org/bot7870937947:AAHJY3kj7_P1YUFpqGMWRI2Dx-YfBRfBaHI/sendMessage?chat_id=7010295728&text=Congratulations+<username>+has+just+completed+a+major+milestone+in+Anuvruddhi!. Make sure the Telegram bot is properly connected, and that the chat ID is valid. Each of these actions should trigger an automatic message to a pre-set Telegram channel to notify the community about the user’s progress. Ensure that all Firebase and Telegram connections remain secure and seamless. The app must offer a beautiful, dark-blue themed experience with diamond-like shining accents and the tagline: “Flourish with Nature. Rise with Purpose.”after opening the volunteer registration form it has to contain the academic details of students like previous year marksheet for the proof and current college name, apaar id of student college no. the city where college is present and at the starting of the app first tab is always a sign up tab and then sign in because when new users open it they have to sign up first by choosing their google account or by entering the email id and password and if they are already sign up the then check this they are already exist in data on firebase or not if they and if they exist in it then show the option of sign in for the earlier users.
